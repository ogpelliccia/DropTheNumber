# DropTheNumber
A PC version of Drop The Number written with C++ and the SFML Graphics Library

Current version: v0.4 - Released on March 20, 2025

## About
Drop The Number is a popular puzzle-based game that can be found on various websites and platforms, most notably on iOS and Android. My main goal for this project is to create a PC port of one of my favorite mobile games while also gaining experience with using C++ and the SFML Graphics library. There is an official PC port of Drop the Number, but it uses alot of CPU resources when it shouldn't. This would be a less CPU-intensive take on that port.

## IMPORTANT: Note about Merging Tiles
If you run this game, you might notice that you can merge tiles down, but you cannot merge left and right. Currently, I am still trying to figure out how to do this properly. The next version, v0.5, will have this merging feature available.

## Getting Started (WIP)
### Prerequisites:
- SFML v2.x.x or later

Currently, I write this game with Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition running on Windows 10. To make it easier to build the source code, I have all of the files you need to build the solution in Visual Studio. Make sure to add all of the DLLs and texture files after building.
